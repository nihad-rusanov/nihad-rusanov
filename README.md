## 📂 Featured Projects
Here are some of my favorite projects that I’m proud to share:

### [Project 1: Fraud Detection](https://github.com/nihad-rusanov/fraud-detection)
**Description**: this project, "Credit Card Fraud Detection Using Logistic Regression with SMOTE," focuses on identifying fraudulent credit card transactions. It uses logistic regression to classify transactions, addressing data imbalance through SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) to enhance model accuracy on the minority class (fraud). Key stages include data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, SMOTE-based resampling, model training, and performance evaluation using metrics like ROC-AUC score and confusion matrix. The project requires libraries such as pandas, scikit-learn, and imbalanced-learn and employs Kaggle’s Credit Card Fraud Detection dataset.
